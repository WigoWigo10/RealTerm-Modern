This is an open-source initiative to modernize the classic **RealTerm** serial terminal for Windows. While RealTerm remains a powerful and beloved tool for engineers and developers, its codebase and user interface reflect an older era of software development.

This project aims to bring RealTerm into the modern development landscape by focusing on three core pillars:

* **Codebase Refactoring:** Migrating the original Object Pascal source code to the latest version of Delphi, replacing obsolete components, and improving the architecture for stability and maintainability.
* **UI/UX Redesign:** Rebuilding the user interface with the modern Delphi VCL framework to provide a clean, intuitive, and responsive user experience, including support for high-DPI displays and themes (light/dark).
* **Modern Automation API:** Evolving the scripting capabilities from legacy ActiveX/COM to a more robust solution, such as an enhanced command-line interface (CLI) or a REST API.
